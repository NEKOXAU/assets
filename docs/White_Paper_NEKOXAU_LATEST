# White Paper NEKOXAU V1.1
Version 1.1 — Published on July 13, 2025

---

## 🔸 Introduction

NEKOXAU wasn’t made for hype.  
It was born from conviction — in the body of a golden cat.

In a world full of FOMO and scams, NEKOXAU stands for extreme patience, unshakable belief, and digital legacy.

---

## 🔸 Narrative

This cat is not just a meme.  
It’s a digital legacy in the body of a cat.  
It doesn’t sell. It doesn’t chase hype. It waits. Builds. Watches.

NEKOXAU is a symbol of radical patience and eternal conviction.  
It does not chase numbers — it chases meaning.  
It doesn’t seek fast riches — it builds something time can’t destroy.

---

## 🔸 Vision

To become the true symbol of the crypto world — born not from hype, but from belief.

We don’t chase market cap.  
We’re here to prove:

**“What seems absurd may become eternal.  
And those who wait may inherit the world.”**

---

## 🔸 Mission

- Build a true holder community, not panic sellers.  
- Make NEKOXAU a symbol of meaningful wealth.  
- Lead through legacy, not trend.  
- Represent digital resilience.  
- Turn a meme into gold: community, value, belief.
